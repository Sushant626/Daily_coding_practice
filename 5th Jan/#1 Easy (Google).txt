This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number 'k', return whether any two numbers from the list add up to 'k'.
Eg) [10,15,3,7] and k=17 ; function returns true since 10+7=17

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass? 


{
	Done in 3 tries -- 
		1. The 'list(input())' breaks every character into an element of the list.
		2. The 'eval(input())' makes a numeric array into a tuple by default.
		3. Success [used 'list(eval(input()))']
