This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index 'i' of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at 'i'
For example, if input array is [1,2,3,4,5], the expected output would be [120,60,40,30,24] while if input is [3,2,1] then output would be [2,3,6]

Follow up: What if you can't use division?

	With Division, done on the first try.
	Without Division, made a small flowchart in a rough notebook but done on the first try.
